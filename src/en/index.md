# Welcome to the DevX workgroup!

This working group is part of the CNRS research group GDR GPL, and is devoted to any topics related to developer experiences. Developers can be software engineers, scientists, domain experts, etc…

The working group is interested in a variety of topics including, but not limited to:
 - Program comprehension
 - Programming interface (e.g., notebook)
 - Programming style (e.g., live, exploratory, literate programming)
 - Design and implementation of program representations and their means of interaction for end-users of all ages
 - Design and implementation of visual programming environments
 - Languages and their environments with mixed notations
 - Abstraction engineering
 - Methods to support working with abstractions, such as example-based programming, omniscient debugging, etc.
 - Input and output devices for interacting with programming environments
 - Infrastructures, meta-tools and framework for tool implementation/creation

More details here on: [DevX Scientific Challenges](https://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2025_01/a2.pdf)
  
The working group holds yearly meetings to discuss the above subjects and organizes a dedicated session at the French software engineering days, which are held by the CNRS GDR GPL.

# GT DevX website

This website presents the activities and events of the CNRS - GDR GPL DevX workgroup.

## How to add a post to the website?

Write a Markdown file with the content of the post.  
The Markdown file must be stored under:
- /src/fr/posts: for the French version of the post.
- /src/en/posts: for the English version of the post. 

Below is the header to integrate to the Markdown you are creating.  
Do not forget the language parameter, it must be consistent with the storage folder.

```markdown
